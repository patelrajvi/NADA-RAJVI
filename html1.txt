<h3 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"><i> How do I make healthy food choices?</i></h3><p>It's important to understand the nutritional value of the food you are buying. You can do this by reading the nutrition panel found on the back of all packaged items in Australia.
Food labels can tell you things like the amount of energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates, sugars, fibre and sodium (salt) in each product, as well as the recommended serving size. </p>
